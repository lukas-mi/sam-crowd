    <h3>Annotation user interface</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>There are two modes that you can switch between:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><img style="width: 100px" src="/static/images/components_icon.png"> mode for annotating the components of an argument via text highlighting.</p>
        <p>
          Once mode is selected you can highlight the text of an article, which causes annotation widget to appear.
          In annotation widget you need to specify the tag of the component.
          In the widget there is auto-completion, so when you start typing the name of a tag suggestions will appear and you can choose one of them.
          Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> button.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to delete the highlighted component, <strong>Components</strong> mode needs to be active.
          Then, you select the already highlighted text and in the widget click

      Similarly, it will change back to <strong>Components</strong> mode once a link is created. You can of course change the mode manually by toggling the switch.

    <h3>The high-level view of arguments</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>An argument consists of at least two statements. The simplest argument includes one <strong>claim</strong>, which is then supported or attacked by at least one <strong>premise</strong>.</p>
    <p>The claim stands for a controversial or polarising statement intended to persuade the reader. It is usually a proposition or assumption and should not be accepted by the reader without additional support. This characteristic distinguishes arguments from explanations where the conclusion is a true statement that is not arguable (e.g. a true event that happened in the past).</p>
    <p>The second component of an argument is the premise. The author uses it as a support/justification for their claim in order to make it more convincing. The premise may also attack/refute the opponent's claim where the goal is to reduce its plausibility. In more complex arguments premises may express support/attack to the claim indirectly, via supporting/attacking another premise that is then directly connected to the claim.</p>

    <h3>Determining component boundaries</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Before marking and identifying argument components as well as the relations between them, it is important to understand the boundaries of each individual component.</p>

    <h4>Guidelines:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Indicator words or phrases such as “because”, “therefore”, “for example” or “even though” can signal the presence of an argument as in examples <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example1'>E1</a></span>, <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example2'>E2</a></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span>.</p></li>
      <li><p>Arguments may not always include indicator words, requiring more in depth comprehension of what was intended by the author. In the example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example3'>E3</a></span> the first sentence is the claim, which is explained/supported by the premise in the second sentence.</p></li>
      <li><p>Components may or may not cover the entire sentence as shown in the example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example2'>E2</a></span> where the first full sentence is annotated as one component (a premise), while in example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example1'>E1</a></span> the first sentence contains two components (a claim followed by a supporting premise).</p></li>
      <li><p>Components cannot span multiple sentences, meaning they always start and end in the same sentence.</li>
      <li><p>Component text is always continuous, that is, it cannot start at some point, be interrupted by a non-component text or a completely different component, and continue afterward.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>Annotating several premises in one sentence:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>If premises serve different purposes, they should be annotated separately. This is illustrated in example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span> where none of the premises in the second sentence have the same exact function (see <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span> description).</p></li>
          <li><p>If premises serve the same purpose, they should be annotated as one component. In example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example5'>E5</a></span> both premises in the second sentence directly support the same claim, thus, they are annotated as one premise.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Parts of a sentence that should not be annotated:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Punctuations at the end of an argument component.</p></li>
          <li><p>Indicator words or phrases such as “because”, “therefore”, “for example” or “even though” (examples <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example1'>E1</a></span>, <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example2'>E2</a></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span>).</p></li>
          <li><p>Unnecessary phrases like “I believe that”, “according to the previous fact” at the start of a component should not be included in the components (see example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example2'>E2</a></span>), unless they contain negations, which change the meaning of an argument, for instance, the claim in the first sentence of example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span>.</p></li>
          <li><p>When in doubt on what not to include in a component, a good rule of thumb is to try to exclude the phrase/words and see if the remaining content still holds the same meaning and can form a valid sentence on its own. Some phrases, for instance, time indicators: “In ancient times” or “currently” are necessary as they add important detail to the argument, without which the meaning of an argument is different.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Identifying components and relations between them</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>In the examples so far you have seen a general view of the claim, however, we are interested in 3 specific types of claims: <strong>MajorClaim</strong>, <strong>ClaimFor</strong>, and <strong>ClaimAgainst</strong>.</p>

    <p>In an article, MajorClaim represents the author's main point directed toward some specific topic. Both ClaimFor and ClaimAgainst can be interpreted as sub-claims and in the following parts of the guide will be referred to as just claims. The purpose of claims is to either directly support (ClaimFor) or, in case of a counterclaim (contra argument), attack (ClaimAgainst) the author’s main view/opinion, represented by the MajorClaim.</p>

    <p>A <strong>Premise</strong> is a reason given for supporting or attacking an argument, therefore, it can be considered as justification or refutation for convincing the reader of the truth or falsity of a claim. Often premises are used to explain claims, illustrate examples proving a point, reference a study that attempts to prove or debunk a claim and so on.</p>

    <p>Besides the components, we also have two relations, namely <strong>Support</strong> and <strong>Attack</strong>, which link Premises to other components.</p>

    <h4>Guidelines:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Identifying claims:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>A statement that is not argumentative should <strong>not</strong> be considered a claim. However, it might still be used in an argument in the form of a premise, to convey support/attack toward some claim. For instance, in the second sentence of example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span>, a figure is quoted from a research. Text is marked as a premise since it supports the claim in the previous sentence.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>Common types of statements that are <strong>not</strong> claims:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Well-known facts or historic events:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>“About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered, and the oceans hold about 96.5 percent of all Earth's water.”</p></li>
                  <li><p>“The American Civil War was a conflict fought between 1861 and 1865 in the United States.”</p></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Personal preference or experience:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>“I’d much rather eat something that is more expensive but sustainable than feel guilty for negatively contributing to climate change.”</p></li>
                  <li><p>“In my interactions with people, who suffer from unhealthy eating habits, I’ve noticed that many of them were never properly introduced to the basics of good nutrition.”</p></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Citing a research:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>“A recent study found that hybrid vehicles may emit considerably larger amounts of CO2 than officially reported by the manufacturers.”</p></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li><p>There can be many regular claims (ClaimFor and ClaimAgainst) in the article that express a stance toward the major claim (see <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example7'>E7</a></span>).</p></li>
          <li><p>Major claims and regular claims may start with opinion expressions such as “In my opinion”, “I strongly believe that” or indicator phrases like “Therefore”, “This follows that” as illustrated in example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span>.</p></li>
          <li><p>Sometimes claims do not start with opinion expressions or indicator phrases. For instance, in example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example7'>E7</a></span>, even though the author expresses their stance in the second sentence, it does not include any content-relevant information of an argument. Therefore, the view, referenced in the first sentences, should be annotated instead.</p></li>
          <li><p>In rare cases claims may appear standalone, meaning without any related premises that would express support or attack toward these claims.</p></li>

          <li>
            <p>Claims formulated as questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>When a question prompts someone to consider a particular point of view that is arguable, it should be annotated as a claim. In the example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span> second to last question claims that there are many people who take part in activities damaging the ocean, however, it may be argued that this is an exaggeration.</p></li>
              <li><p>However, too general, obvious answer or rhetorical questions are not claims. For instance: “Why are we so irresponsible?” or “How can we claim to care about the environment and still use single-use plastic?".</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Identifying Premise components and how they relate to other components:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Like regular claims, there can be many Premise components present in the text.</p></li>
          <li>
            <p>A Premise expresses justification or refutation to another component via Support or Attack relations:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>In the simplest and most common case, a premise is linked directly to a regular claim (ClaimFor/ClaimAgainst) with Support/Attack relation. This is shown in arguments from example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span>.</p></li>
              <li><p>In other cases Premise can instead be connected to another Premise, thus, forming an indirect relation to a claim via intermediate components (can be more than one). Example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example7'>E7</a></span> illustrates such a case, where in the third paragraph a claim is supported by the first premise, while the second premise attacks the first one.</p></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><p>A Premise can only be related to exactly one other component and it cannot be itself.</p></li>
          <li><p>Unlike regular claims, premises cannot exist standalone: it should always be linked to another component, otherwise, a piece of text should not be annotated as a premise.</p></li>
          <li><p>A component (premise or regular claim) can be supported/attacked by more than one premise.</p></li>
          <li><p>In more complex situations it is possible for premises to form longer chains of reasoning, which end with regular claims (see example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example4'>E4</a></span>).</p></li>
          <li><p>Usually premises are located close to other components they relate to, for instance, in the same paragraph or section in an article.</p></li>
          <li><p>In rarer cases arguments might span multiple paragraphs. One example of such a situation could be when one claim is given in a starting paragraph, while the following paragraphs contain premises that express support/attack to the claim. Thus, premises from the later paragraphs should still be connected to the claim from the previous paragraph via Support/Attack relations.</p></li>
          <li><p>There could also be instances when it may seem that a premise can potentially be connected to several other components. In such cases prioritise the component that is located closest and link the premise to it. For instance, in example <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span>, the last premise seems fit to support any other component in the last paragraph. However, the link is drawn to the previous annotated component because it’s the closest to the premise.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Sometimes it is difficult to tell whether a component of an argument is a regular claim or just a premise that should be connected to another component. It is advisable to consider:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>Whether this component has a direct stance toward the major claim. If so, then it is a regular claim.</p></li>
          <li><p>On the other hand, if it seems that the component better fits an auxiliary role (i.e. an explanation or an example) then it should be annotated as a premise and connected to another component it relates to.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If two or more potential premises seem to drive a similar point and there is no obvious regular claim to connect them to, it may be that one of the premises is actually a regular claim.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>In such a case, choose the one that appears to be most general (i.e. concluding) and annotate it as a regular claim (ClaimFor/ClaimAgainst).</p></li>
          <li><p>Then annotate the remaining components as premises that Support the regular claim.</p></li>
          <li><p>Again, it is important to remember that the selected regular claim should convey a view toward the major claim, if it is not the case, then, none of the potential premises should be annotated at all.</p></li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li><p>A piece of text that is neither argumentative (claim) nor related to an argument (premise) should not be annotated at all. <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example7'>E7</a></span> exemplifies such a case. In the second paragraph a general experience is described, which neither claims something nor supports/attacks a claim. Second sentence in the paragraph is used to raise intrigue and provoke the reader.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example6'>E6</a></span> and <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href='#example7'>E7</a></span> show more complete annotated examples of the two articles with their titles, and brief explanations of how components are related to each other.</p>

    <h4>Examples:</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold" id="example6">E6</span>:</p>
        <p><img src="/static/images/ann_example_6.png" alt="annotation example #6"></p>
      </dt>
      <dd>Title: "Sustainable Fishing: Balancing the Needs of People and the Ocean".</dd>
      <dd>
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <p>
          The major claim is stated as the last sentence in the first paragraph.
          The first sentence contains a claim that can be interpreted as against the major claim, since stricter regulation might affect food security in the developing countries.
          The following sentence cites research figures, which supports the claim from the previous sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the second paragraph there are two claims, which are for the major claim. Each of them is supported by respective premises that follow.
          The first premise gives an example of a destructive fishing method, while the second premise provides a possible motivating factor for illegal fishing practices.

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold" id="example7">E7</span>:</p>
        <p><img src="/static/images/ann_example_7.png" alt="annotation example #7">
        </p>
      </dt>
      <dd>Title: "This World Plant Milk Day, A Reminder Of Why The Future Must Be Dairy-Free".</dd>
      <dd>
        <p>Explanation:</p>
        <p>
          The major claim is first stated in the first paragraph and is again paraphrased in the last one.
          Even though the second sentence clearly shows author's opinion, it is not annotated as the major claim since it does not contain any content of an argument.
          However, this sentence refers to the previous one that does have a claim, therefore, is marked as the major claim.</p>
        <p>
          The next paragraph does not have any pieces of text that are argumentative (claim) or related to an argument (premise).
          Therefore, no components are highlighted. In the paragraph a general experience is described, which neither claims something nor supports/attacks a claim.
          Second sentence in the paragraph is used to raise intrigue and provoke the reader.
        </p>
        <p>The third paragraph starts with a premise, which provides explanation for the ClaimFor in the second sentence.</p>
        <p>
          In the fourth paragraph a positive view of animal husbandry is stated, which is against the major claim that talks about animal cruelty.
          This ClaimAgainst is then supported by a premise describing that animals do have freedom for some part of the year.
          On the other hand, in the same sentence there is another premise that attacks (reduces convincing value) the previous one by emphasising poor living condition during colder periods.
