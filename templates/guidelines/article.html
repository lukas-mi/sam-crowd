  <p>In this task you will need to highlight major claim occurrences in the text.</p>

  <p>Be sure to dedicate a good portion of the given time to carefully read all the sections below before you proceed with the annotation.</p>

  <p>Leave a few minutes for a short feedback questionnaire after the main annotation task.</p>

  <hr>
  <p>Components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>MajorClaim</strong>: <span class="major-claim">highlighting example</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>ClaimFor</strong>: <span class="claim-for">highlighting example</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>ClaimAgainst</strong>: <span class="claim-against">highlighting example</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Premise</strong>: <span class="premise">highlighting example</span>.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Relations: <strong>Support</strong>, <strong>Attack</strong>.</p>

  <p>
    The last 3 types of components as well as both types of relations are not part of this task, therefore, should <strong>not</strong> be annotated.
    Only <strong>MajorClaim</strong> occurrences should be annotated.
