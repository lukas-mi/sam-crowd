T3	Premise 493 565	factory farming is linked to an increased likelihood of future pandemics
T4	MajorClaim 567 695	These issues combined make it clear that a move away from meat is essential, and cultivated meat has been heralded as the answer
T5	Claim 697 792	Currently, it is only available in Singapore, and has yet to be approved in any other countries
A3	Stance T5 Against
T6	Premise 794 916	Lengthy regulatory approval processes and consumer wariness look to be hard-to-overcome obstacles for its continued growth

A4	Stance T7 For
T8	Premise 1029 1147	Created by blending plant-based protein with cultivated meat, the result is supposedly a cleaner, tastier meat product

A5	Stance T9 For
T10	Claim 1619 1683	The process of bringing cultured meat to consumers is not simple
A6	Stance T10 Against
T11	Premise 1685 1904	While the production mechanics, which see single cells taken, supposedly painlessly, from animals and then grown in bioreactors to create meat products, is more widely understood, approvals have been slow to materialize

T16	Premise 2444 2513	The EU has also been slow to support its burgeoning cultivated sector

T19	Claim 3015 3116	As a route to gain consumer acceptance of cultivated meat, hybrid products are not guaranteed success
A8	Stance T19 Against
T20	Premise 3118 3320	Given that hesitation is largely predicated on a feeling that meat grown in bioreactors is less natural than that produced by slaughter, hybrid developments may face exactly the same consumer reluctance

T22	Premise 3385 3422	it won’t accelerate acceptance either
