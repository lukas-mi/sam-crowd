T2	Premise 192 326	Cultivated meat (also referred to as cultured and clean meat) is being hailed by those in the sector as the future of sustainable food
T3	Premise 328 456	Animal agriculture is catastrophic for the environment, responsible for at least 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
T4	Premise 458 565	It’s also a public health risk, as factory farming is linked to an increased likelihood of future pandemics

T8	Premise 918 1027	As a way to gently usher cultured meat products into the food system, hybrid developments are being suggested
T9	Premise 1029 1147	Created by blending plant-based protein with cultivated meat, the result is supposedly a cleaner, tastier meat product
T10	Premise 1149 1217	It also requires no intensive animal agriculture or animal slaughter
T11	Premise 1219 1301	American news publication Vox compares the move to the introduction of hybrid cars
T12	Premise 1303 1396	It says that they eventually led to the accepted commercialization of fully electric vehicles
T13	Premise 1407 1545	the success of hybrid meat will likely hinge on capturing a specific contingent of consumers who are already open to cultured developments
T14	Claim 1551 1566	is it necessary
A1	Stance T14 For
T15	Claim 1619 1683	The process of bringing cultured meat to consumers is not simple
A2	Stance T15 For
T16	Premise 1685 1904	While the production mechanics, which see single cells taken, supposedly painlessly, from animals and then grown in bioreactors to create meat products, is more widely understood, approvals have been slow to materialize
T17	Premise 1906 2019	To date, only Singapore has granted regulatory approval for the production and commercial sale of cultivated meat
T18	Premise 2021 2116	Even then, it has only given permission for two chicken developments from one company, Eat Just
T19	Premise 2118 2309	Despite rumors that the US would be following suit a year ago, with domestic cultivated interest Upside Foods building a large production facility in readiness, no approvals have been granted
T20	Premise 2311 2442	Though President Biden appears to have recently given the green light for progression in his recent biotech-focused executive order
T21	Premise 2444 2513	The EU has also been slow to support its burgeoning cultivated sector
T22	Premise 2515 2622	This is the case despite it including major players such as the Netherlands’ Mosa Meat and France’s Gourmey
T23	Claim 2624 2763	Aside from a lack of infrastructure in place to support global cultivated production, consumer perceptions could also stunt sector progress
A3	Stance T23 For
T24	Premise 2765 2876	Last year, an Australian study reported that 72 percent of diners are not willing to consider cultured meat yet
T25	Premise 2878 2970	The findings are significant, as Australia is one of the biggest consumers of meat worldwide
T26	Claim 3015 3116	As a route to gain consumer acceptance of cultivated meat, hybrid products are not guaranteed success
A4	Stance T26 For
T27	Premise 3118 3320	Given that hesitation is largely predicated on a feeling that meat grown in bioreactors is less natural than that produced by slaughter, hybrid developments may face exactly the same consumer reluctance
T28	Premise 3322 3422	It will also be subject to the same regulatory delays, meaning it won’t accelerate acceptance either
T29	Claim 3497 3568	Some manufacturers might claim that it will bolster flexitarian numbers
A5	Stance T29 Against
T30	Premise 3579 3661	other observers have identified that standard hybrid products are already doing so
T31	Claim 3663 3833	Blending plant proteins with conventional meat to reduce the amount of animal protein in popular products such as burgers and sausages is witnessing a surge in popularity
A6	Stance T31 Against
T32	Claim 3871 3983	such developments are seen as a healthy alternative to standard meat and tastier than straight-up vegan products
