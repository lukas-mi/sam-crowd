T1	MajorClaim 643 813	Animal agriculture is catastrophic for the environment, contributing to land degradation, water, and air pollution, resource use, loss of biodiversity, and global warming
T2	Premise 815 971	While there’s debate in the scientific community on the proportion of emissions it’s responsible for, it is generally understood to be at least 14.5 percent
T3	Claim 973 1109	While animal agriculture is of course not the only issue that needs addressing, it should be an essential part of any environmental plan
A1	Stance T3 For
T4	Premise 1111 1388	A major study from 2018 found that Western countries would need to reduce beef consumption by 90 percent to avoid dangerous climate change, and the UN recently endorseda report urging world leaders to shift away from animal agriculture and move towards plant-based food systems
T5	Premise 1390 1557	Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, there remains a reluctance from politicians and the general public to accept that we urgently need to switch up our diets
T6	Claim 1856 2044	We need urgent action from governments to help food systems shift to plant-based if we are to meet climate goals and keep vital ecosystems alive – but is taxing meat the way to go about it
A2	Stance T6 For
T7	Premise 2046 2262	A study from the University of Oxford published in January 2022, which looked at the effect taxing meat would have in countries like the US, UK, and Australia concluded that doing so would indeed help the environment
T8	Premise 2264 2393	It found that increasing costs by 20-60 percent (depending on meat type), would reduce the consumption of the most damaging foods
T9	Premise 2395 2639	The study stated that the average retail price for meat in high-income countries would need to increase by 35-56 percent for beef, 25 percent for poultry, and 19 percent for lamb and pork to reflect the environmental impacts of their production
T10	Claim 2670 2796	it’s undeniable that increases such as these would at first glance seem to be contributing to already sky-rocketing food costs
A3	Stance T10 Against
T11	Claim 2802 2886	critics of the meat tax have argued that it would disproportionately effect the poor
A4	Stance T11 Against
T12	Premise 2974 3191	If such a tax were introduced, it is arguable that the fall in consumption would be largely due to the fact that some people would no longer be able to afford it, while the richest would continue buying meat unscathed
T13	Premise 3444 3713	Researchers in the Oxford study found that, as well as its ability to reduce meat consumption, one of the ‘key advantages’ of meat tax is that it could create revenue to help farmers move to alternative income streams and give support to people from low-income families
T14	Premise 3715 3887	“There are ways to ensure that meat taxes do not put additional financial pressure on those with low income,” said Franziska Funke, lead author, and researcher in the study
T15	Premise 3889 4028	“That is why we suggest that meat tax revenues should be redistributed to support low-income households or subsidize fruit and vegetables.”
T16	Claim 4029 4142	According to this research, most people on low incomes could end up with more money than before a meat tax reform
A5	Stance T16 For
T17	Claim 4154 4252	Some people may argue that this system is unfair and would leave people lacking in vital nutrition
A6	Stance T17 Against
T18	Premise 4258 4500	the idea that meat is an essential part of our diet comes from decades of clever marketing and ignores the numerous studies that have concluded plant-based diets are optimum for humans, as well as the link between meat consumption and disease
T19	Premise 4515 4608	the long-term aim should not be that some people continue eating meat while others go without
T20	Claim 4610 4683	A meat tax could be a vital step in tackling the meat consumption problem
A7	Stance T20 For
T21	Claim 4722 4818	Governments should work to make plant-based diets the norm by making them accessible to everyone
A8	Stance T21 For
T22	Premise 4820 4957	The reason why meat products are so prevalent in our society is because governments give away billions in subsidies to animal agriculture
T23	Premise 4959 5116	Subsidies are tax-payer-funded grants that governments give to industries to keep down costs, therefore making their products more accessible to the consumer
T24	Premise 5133 5231	It is thought that the tax-payer provides more than $1 million per minute in global farm subsidies
T25	Premise 5233 5330	In the UK, around 90 percent of the income of farmers with grazing livestock comes from subsidies
T26	Premise 5332 5401	In the US, tens of billions of dollars are given to farmers each year
T27	Premise 5403 5505	The Trump administration gave a $16 billion support package payout on top of regular subsidies in 2019
T28	Premise 5578 5722	This level of support has created a system where unhealthy meat products – like cheap fast food – are more accessible than fruits and vegetables
T29	Claim 5724 5857	If crop farming was given this funding, it has the potential to provide far cheaper food for more people than our current system does
A9	Stance T29 For
T30	Premise 5859 6020	Crop farming requires considerably less land and resources than animal farming and would be vastly more efficient at feeding the population if it was prioritized
T31	MajorClaim 6022 6215	We are wasting money that could be used to make widespread cheaper food on ailing industries that are inept at feeding the population and accelerating the world toward environmental destruction
T32	Claim 6233 6390	Governments should stop subsidizing meat and dairy industries, and instead direct money to crop farming while helping existing animal farmers move towards it
A10	Stance T32 For
T33	Claim 6534 6672	There needs to be an urgent shift in our food system away from animal agriculture, and governments should allocate funding to reflect this
A11	Stance T33 For
T34	Claim 6674 6909	After years of marketing campaigns that sold the public the wildly incorrect idea that meat and dairy is an essential component of a balanced diet, they should also take steps to educate the public on the benefits of plant-based eating
