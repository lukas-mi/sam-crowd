T1	Claim 643 813	Animal agriculture is catastrophic for the environment, contributing to land degradation, water, and air pollution, resource use, loss of biodiversity, and global warming
A1	Stance T1 For
T2	Premise 815 971	While there’s debate in the scientific community on the proportion of emissions it’s responsible for, it is generally understood to be at least 14.5 percent
T3	Claim 973 1109	While animal agriculture is of course not the only issue that needs addressing, it should be an essential part of any environmental plan
A2	Stance T3 For
T4	Premise 1111 1249	A major study from 2018 found that Western countries would need to reduce beef consumption by 90 percent to avoid dangerous climate change
T5	Premise 1255 1388	the UN recently endorseda report urging world leaders to shift away from animal agriculture and move towards plant-based food systems
T6	Premise 1643 1741	An IPCC report published in April 2022 proclaimed that it’s ‘now or never’ to limit global heating
T7	Claim 1856 2044	We need urgent action from governments to help food systems shift to plant-based if we are to meet climate goals and keep vital ecosystems alive – but is taxing meat the way to go about it
A3	Stance T7 For
T8	Premise 2046 2262	A study from the University of Oxford published in January 2022, which looked at the effect taxing meat would have in countries like the US, UK, and Australia concluded that doing so would indeed help the environment
T9	Premise 2278 2393	increasing costs by 20-60 percent (depending on meat type), would reduce the consumption of the most damaging foods
T10	Premise 2417 2639	the average retail price for meat in high-income countries would need to increase by 35-56 percent for beef, 25 percent for poultry, and 19 percent for lamb and pork to reflect the environmental impacts of their production
T11	Claim 2691 2796	increases such as these would at first glance seem to be contributing to already sky-rocketing food costs
A4	Stance T11 Against
T12	Claim 2802 2886	critics of the meat tax have argued that it would disproportionately effect the poor
A5	Stance T12 Against
T13	Premise 2974 3191	If such a tax were introduced, it is arguable that the fall in consumption would be largely due to the fact that some people would no longer be able to afford it, while the richest would continue buying meat unscathed
T14	Premise 3444 3713	Researchers in the Oxford study found that, as well as its ability to reduce meat consumption, one of the ‘key advantages’ of meat tax is that it could create revenue to help farmers move to alternative income streams and give support to people from low-income families
T15	Premise 4029 4142	According to this research, most people on low incomes could end up with more money than before a meat tax reform
T16	Claim 4154 4252	Some people may argue that this system is unfair and would leave people lacking in vital nutrition
A6	Stance T16 Against
T17	Premise 4258 4500	the idea that meat is an essential part of our diet comes from decades of clever marketing and ignores the numerous studies that have concluded plant-based diets are optimum for humans, as well as the link between meat consumption and disease
T18	Claim 4820 4957	The reason why meat products are so prevalent in our society is because governments give away billions in subsidies to animal agriculture
A7	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 5133 5231	It is thought that the tax-payer provides more than $1 million per minute in global farm subsidies
T20	Premise 5233 5330	In the UK, around 90 percent of the income of farmers with grazing livestock comes from subsidies
T21	Premise 5332 5401	In the US, tens of billions of dollars are given to farmers each year
T22	Premise 5403 5576	The Trump administration gave a $16 billion support package payout on top of regular subsidies in 2019, while at the same time cutting $5 billion from the food stamps budget
T23	Claim 5724 5857	If crop farming was given this funding, it has the potential to provide far cheaper food for more people than our current system does
A8	Stance T23 For
T24	Premise 5859 6020	Crop farming requires considerably less land and resources than animal farming and would be vastly more efficient at feeding the population if it was prioritized
T25	MajorClaim 6233 6390	Governments should stop subsidizing meat and dairy industries, and instead direct money to crop farming while helping existing animal farmers move towards it
T26	MajorClaim 6534 6672	There needs to be an urgent shift in our food system away from animal agriculture, and governments should allocate funding to reflect this
