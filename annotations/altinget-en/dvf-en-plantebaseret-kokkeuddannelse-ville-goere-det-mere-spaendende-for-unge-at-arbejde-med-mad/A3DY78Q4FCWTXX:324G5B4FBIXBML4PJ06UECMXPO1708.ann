T1	MajorClaim 100 272	The government should prioritize financing the development of a plant-based cookery education, which can secure Denmark's place on the gastronomically sustainable world map
T2	Premise 333 369	The cooking education is out of date
T3	Premise 371 401	The working conditions are bad
T4	Premise 407 564	the young chef students are not trained to be able to handle themselves in the green kitchen, even though this is what many restaurants and canteens call for
T5	Claim 577 802	the Danish Vegetarian Association suggests that the politicians, in addition to prioritizing a better working environment, allocate funds for the development of a green, interesting and visionary plant-based cooking education
A1	Stance T5 For
T6	Premise 824 1112	In a debate at the Alting on 9 May, Kasper Fogh Hansen, chairman of the board of the Food People's Assembly, says that it is too uninteresting for young people to work with food today, and that the number of students on the cookery course has fallen by a third in the last couple of years
T7	Premise 1145 1335	there is actually a large crowd of vegetarians, vegans and climate-conscious young people out there who would consider a chef's degree if it were up-to-date, visionary, green and plant-based
T8	Premise 1337 1631	It is not only experiences such as the horrific testimonies about working conditions and sexist culture mentioned in Politiken that make more skilled chefs nervous, but also the great focus on climate-sinning lost hare, chops and meatballs, which deters young people from attending the training
T9	MajorClaim 1644 1839	the government and the supporting parties should prioritize funding the development of plant-based cooking education, which can secure Denmark's place on the gastronomically sustainable world map
T10	Premise 1849 1920	young people are climate-conscious and prioritize climate-friendly food
T11	Premise 1922 2000	This is what is interesting for them professionally – also on a cookery course
T12	Premise 2051 2128	The existing education is based on what is colloquially called the "cookbook"
T13	Premise 2130 2307	The book defines the content of the education, academic goals, description of the goals of the internship and which recipes the students can come up with for the apprentice test
T14	Premise 2309 2455	Meat takes up 70 pages in the cookbook, fish takes up approximately 33 pages, while pulses have very graciously been allocated just over two pages
T15	Claim 2491 2628	there is no plan for the cooking education to prioritize green cuisine – not to mention a gastronomy that reflects the dietary guidelines
A2	Stance T15 For
T16	Premise 2630 2799	In the Official Dietary Guidelines, the recommended intake of legumes is 700 grams per week, while Danes are recommended to reduce meat consumption to 350 grams per week
T17	Claim 2801 2943	Shouldn't chefs who are trained in 2022 be able to cook exactly the food that the dietary guidelines recommend and that the population demands
A3	Stance T17 For
T18	Premise 3393 3550	we are aware of several vegans and vegetarians who have dropped out or opted out of the cookery course because they are forced to work with meat in a big way
T19	Claim 3552 3766	It is discrimination, which is probably on the edge of human rights, that as a vegetarian you can only take the cooking course if you are prepared to prepare meat and thus go against your own ethics and convictions
A4	Stance T19 For
T20	Premise 3781 3887	the production of meat and dairy products also emits far more greenhouse gases than vegetables and legumes
T21	Premise 3889 4012	In addition, there is the whole animal ethical aspect, which is important to many young people who eat vegan and vegetarian
T22	Claim 4014 4150	But if animal products are no longer to be part of the cooking education sub-elements, it is the politicians who must legislate for this
A5	Stance T22 For
T23	Premise 4152 4274	In recent years, Denmark is moving rapidly towards green gastronomy and the development of plant-based restaurant concepts
T24	Premise 4276 4456	Restaurants such as ARK, Bistro Lupa, VeVe and Geraniums Angelika have gone all in on the green and sustainable, and several canteen and catering companies have become much greener
T25	Premise 4462 4521	the chefs they can hire have been tested in chops in a dish
T26	Premise 4523 4717	Many of the players therefore arrange internal further training in vegetables, pulses and preparation themselves, because the newly trained chefs simply do not have the skills that are in demand
T27	Premise 4719 4832	At the same time, we see that the public kitchens will probably soon have to offer a plant-based option every day
T28	Premise 4834 4939	Aalborg has just introduced it, and a majority in the Danish Parliament is working to adopt it nationally
T29	Claim 4941 5074	It is therefore paradoxical that we as a society do not have a plant-based cooking education where the skills in demand are the focus
A6	Stance T29 For
T30	Premise 5112 5182	Climate and sustainability are at the top of the young people's agenda
T31	Premise 5184 5242	17 percent of Danes in the age group 18-34 eat flexitarian
T32	Premise 5244 5338	Five percent of 18-34-year-olds eat pescetarian, four percent vegetarian and two percent vegan
T33	Claim 5446 5546	the statistics point in one direction – towards plant-based and sustainable cuisine being the future
A7	Stance T33 For
T34	Claim 5559 5696	we recognize that there is a traditional food culture in the existing cooking education and that there is a demand for the classic dishes
A8	Stance T34 Against
T35	Claim 5698 5808	This is also why we are proposing a completely new plant-based trail that can exist alongside the existing one
A9	Stance T35 For
T36	Premise 5810 5959	That the existing education needs a green reformation is also a fact, however, if we take a look at demand and development in the restaurant industry
