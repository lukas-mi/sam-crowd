T1	MajorClaim 98 187	It is soon only the force of habit and the inertia of our food culture that holds us back
T2	Premise 204 266	these are powerful forces that are difficult to overcome alone
T3	Claim 279 342	we need a push from some of those who have power over our meals
A1	Stance T3 For
T4	Claim 364 470	"Is the crisis scratching in your kitchen? So cook a kilo of chickpeas or add lentils to your meat sauce."
A2	Stance T4 For
T5	Claim 471 620	Such a household council could make several ends meet when we want to take care of the climate, the body and the dwindling balance of the credit card
A3	Stance T5 For
T6	Claim 622 682	Yet it's advice few of us are inclined to follow in practice
A4	Stance T6 Against
T7	Premise 684 784	Madkulturen's figures show this time and time again: Only one in four evening meals contains legumes
T8	Premise 786 821	Half of us rarely or never eat them
T9	Premise 823 977	And the recommendation of 100 grams a day is miles away from a reality where we only reach 2.4 grams, according to the Danish Food and Food Administration
T10	Premise 1086 1139	We are all creatures of habit who do as we usually do
T11	Premise 1141 1283	And usually favors canonized Danish meat dishes over, for example, well-seasoned overseas classics with lentils and chickpeas in the main role
T12	Premise 1619 1732	In Denmark, we used to have the pea as the national leguminous fruit, which was part of countless ordinary dishes
T13	Premise 1734 1891	During the war of 1864, for example, dried peas were a regular part of the field ration, which certainly did not make the common soldier either jump or frown
T14	Premise 1893 1956	But today there are no real legume dishes on the Danes' top ten
T15	Premise 1958 2118	First, quite a bit further down the ranking comes chili con carne, which in its typical Danish version consists of meat with a cosmetic sidekick of kidney beans
T16	Premise 2120 2238	Thus, the dish becomes the exception that confirms the rule of a food culture where legumes shine by their sad absence
T17	Claim 2240 2279	We simply have to do something about it
A5	Stance T17 For
T18	Claim 2281 2305	The soup needs new beans
A6	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 2332 2420	For years we have been soaking in climate food advice and good arguments for more pulses
T20	Premise 2422 2465	We have access to all kinds of good recipes
T21	Premise 2467 2593	And gradually it is possible to get your hands on beans, lentils and peas of all kinds - including Danish ones of good quality
T22	Claim 2595 2717	So has there been no development - if nothing else in our attitude and readiness to accept pulses as part of everyday food
A7	Stance T22 For
T23	Premise 2760 2924	A recent study from the University of Copenhagen showed that Danes' knowledge of pulses is relatively high compared to other countries - despite the low consumption
T24	Premise 2926 3057	And in a fresh survey from Madkulturen, half of us answer that we would like to eat more pulses, while only one in eight rejects it
T25	Premise 3059 3128	Half of us think that legumes fit well into the dishes we already eat
T26	Premise 3130 3193	And very few people find it a problem to offer pulses to others
T27	MajorClaim 3211 3300	It is soon only the force of habit and the inertia of our food culture that holds us back
T28	Premise 3317 3379	these are powerful forces that are difficult to overcome alone
T29	Claim 3392 3455	we need a push from some of those who have power over our meals
A8	Stance T29 For
T30	Premise 3502 3631	A great many of us get a daily lunch made by others â€“ 650,000 from public kitchens alone, to which are added the private canteens
T31	Premise 3633 3724	Furthermore, on a normal evening, one in four eats takeaway, restaurant food or ready meals
T32	Claim 3726 3879	By contracting out the cooking, we open a flank for someone to change our habits and introduce the vegetarian dishes that will soon become the new normal
A9	Stance T32 For
T33	Premise 3881 4081	That step is easier to take for food professionals than for the rest of us, who mostly plan and shop at the last minute, and for two-thirds of whom find it difficult to come up with good legume dishes
T34	Claim 4083 4202	For progressive canteen workers, chefs and kitchen staff, it is good news that we are no longer really afraid of pulses
A10	Stance T34 For
T35	Premise 4204 4315	It is no longer necessary to list lentils in the meat pots or apologize for introducing a weekly vegetarian day
T36	Premise 4317 4391	Something that more and more people are open to, and that some even expect
T37	Claim 4403 4514	this kind of initiative can pave the way for the necessary introduction of legumes into our own cooking at home
A11	Stance T37 For
T38	Premise 4556 4664	A good one-sixth of Danes are already so familiar with pulses that they eat them at least a few times a week
T39	Premise 4666 4743	They constitute a leguminous elite who can lead the way and drag others along
T40	Claim 4745 4804	My appeal to them is: Don't hold back - the future is yours
A12	Stance T40 For
T41	Claim 4806 4916	The same could of course be said for the new generations who will shape the food culture in the coming decades
A13	Stance T41 For
T42	Premise 4918 4980	But we as a society have a special responsibility towards them
T43	Claim 4982 5094	A responsibility to not just reproduce food culture as we know it, but to introduce a new world of possibilities
A14	Stance T43 For
T44	Claim 5096 5148	Not least for good food with beans, lentils and peas
