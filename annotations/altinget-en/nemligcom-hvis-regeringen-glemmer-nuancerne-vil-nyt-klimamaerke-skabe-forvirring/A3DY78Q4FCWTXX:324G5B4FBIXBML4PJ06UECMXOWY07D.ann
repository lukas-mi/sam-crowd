T7	Premise 999 1033	Then consumers get really confused
T8	Premise 1035 1187	A public brand must be able to secure the necessary support and cooperation in the grocery industry, so that consumers are informed uniformly and fairly
T9	Claim 1189 1269	The benefit of cooperating is a more effective climate adjustment of consumption
A6	Stance T9 For
T10	Claim 1317 1393	the scheme must manage to ensure a high level of familiarity among consumers
A7	Stance T10 For
T11	Premise 1395 1465	Here, trust and a large selection of goods are fundamentally necessary
T12	Claim 1467 1568	Credibility and trust must be ensured by an independent certification with firm control of the market
A8	Stance T12 For
T13	Claim 1570 1799	Awareness must be secured through support from manufacturers and the grocery industry, because otherwise the necessary product selection with the brand on it, which can stimulate an interest among consumers, will not be available
A9	Stance T13 For
T14	Premise 1843 2043	consumers' "perceived trust" in a brand is conditioned by a high degree of familiarity, which in turn is conditioned by the fact that the brand can be found via a large selection of different products

A11	Stance T16 For
T17	Premise 2272 2425	Therefore, a "positive label" is something we must avoid, because it only labels the more climate-friendly foods and avoids the more climate-harming ones

A12	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 2513 2619	is a lack of a label due to a climate culprit or simply a food that the producer has opted out of labeling
T20	Premise 2621 2676	We must remember that we are getting a voluntary scheme
T21	Premise 2678 2793	"Positive labeling" also does not support the manufacturer to develop products in a more climate-friendly direction
T22	Claim 2795 2941	A graduated scheme with a color scale "within the various product categories" will be better able to move consumer behavior in the right direction
A13	Stance T22 For
T23	Premise 2943 3159	If you take, for example, the product category "green", this category can be divided into around 10-12 product groups, which can receive a climate score with an average number and a color on a scale from green to red
T24	Premise 3161 3327	The consumer then has the opportunity to move his choice within a category and product group and at the same time gain knowledge to shape a more climate-friendly meal

T32	Premise 4102 4212	There is an exciting positive development underway for the benefit of more truthful food-specific climate data
T33	Claim 4214 4410	A Danish climate label should be able to capture that development, which is why the scheme should be revised every three years, similar to other credible labels, such as the EU Flower and the Swan
A18	Stance T33 For
T34	Premise 4412 4569	If the requirements are tightened or clarified, it is ensured that the brand remains relevant and contributes to long-term knowledge building among consumers
