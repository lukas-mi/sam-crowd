A2	Stance T4 For
T5	Premise 827 857	This cannot happen too quickly
T6	Premise 859 997	If it is too late, companies themselves start making their own climate labels based on different methods and information for the same food
T7	Premise 999 1033	Then consumers get really confused
T8	Claim 1035 1187	A public brand must be able to secure the necessary support and cooperation in the grocery industry, so that consumers are informed uniformly and fairly
A3	Stance T8 For
T9	Premise 1189 1269	The benefit of cooperating is a more effective climate adjustment of consumption
T10	Claim 1317 1393	the scheme must manage to ensure a high level of familiarity among consumers
A4	Stance T10 For
T11	Premise 1401 1465	trust and a large selection of goods are fundamentally necessary
T12	Premise 1467 1568	Credibility and trust must be ensured by an independent certification with firm control of the market
T13	Claim 1570 1655	Awareness must be secured through support from manufacturers and the grocery industry
A5	Stance T13 For
T14	Premise 1675 1799	the necessary product selection with the brand on it, which can stimulate an interest among consumers, will not be available
T15	Premise 1801 2043	An analysis from Dansk Erhverv shows that consumers' "perceived trust" in a brand is conditioned by a high degree of familiarity, which in turn is conditioned by the fact that the brand can be found via a large selection of different products

A6	Stance T16 For
T17	Premise 2144 2270	A system is needed which can support consumers in moving their choices in a more climate-friendly direction on a nuanced basis
T18	Claim 2283 2328	a "positive label" is something we must avoid
A7	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 2338 2425	it only labels the more climate-friendly foods and avoids the more climate-harming ones

A8	Stance T20 For
T21	Premise 2513 2619	is a lack of a label due to a climate culprit or simply a food that the producer has opted out of labeling
T22	Premise 2621 2676	We must remember that we are getting a voluntary scheme
T23	Premise 2678 2793	"Positive labeling" also does not support the manufacturer to develop products in a more climate-friendly direction
T24	Claim 2795 2941	A graduated scheme with a color scale "within the various product categories" will be better able to move consumer behavior in the right direction
A9	Stance T24 For
T25	Premise 2943 3159	If you take, for example, the product category "green", this category can be divided into around 10-12 product groups, which can receive a climate score with an average number and a color on a scale from green to red
T26	Premise 3161 3327	The consumer then has the opportunity to move his choice within a category and product group and at the same time gain knowledge to shape a more climate-friendly meal
T27	Premise 3329 3420	This scheme can be compared to the EU's very successful energy label on electrical products
T28	Claim 3422 3482	A graduated color scale across categories is not a good idea
A10	Stance T28 For
T29	Premise 3492 3616	it limits the information and thus the action to only move away from a climate-damaging food in favor of a less-damaging one
T30	Premise 3618 3682	This does not necessarily meet the consumer's daily needs either
T31	Claim 3748 3830	the label must be used directly on the food and not just on the front of the shelf

T34	Premise 4102 4212	There is an exciting positive development underway for the benefit of more truthful food-specific climate data
T35	Claim 4214 4279	A Danish climate label should be able to capture that development
A12	Stance T35 For
T36	Premise 4294 4410	the scheme should be revised every three years, similar to other credible labels, such as the EU Flower and the Swan
T37	Premise 4412 4569	If the requirements are tightened or clarified, it is ensured that the brand remains relevant and contributes to long-term knowledge building among consumers
T38	Premise 4571 4690	It will probably be a few years before we methodically have the right climate label based on more specific climate data
T39	Claim 4692 4856	A Danish initiative must be able to contribute to international knowledge building, because food is produced and traded internationally, and climate concerns us all
A13	Stance T39 For
T40	Premise 4869 4997	we must now be inspired by ISO, the EU's new PEF method, or by the five to six climate labels that are already on food in the EU
