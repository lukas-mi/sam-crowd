A2	Stance T8 For
T9	Premise 932 1100	I've been remodeling professional kitchens for ten years, and I'd be lying if I said you can't tell the difference on the plate once the remodeling is fully implemented
T10	Premise 1102 1131	The food becomes much greener
T11	Premise 1133 1255	There will be less meat over the course of the week, the ingredients will be more Nordic and the dishes much more seasonal

A3	Stance T12 For

T14	Premise 1554 1704	Meat is – unsurprisingly – the big animal in the CO2 accounts, of which we have eaten accelerating amounts in the Western world over the last 50 years
T15	Claim 1706 1782	Therefore, there is no other quick fix than cutting down on that consumption
A5	Stance T15 For
T16	Claim 1806 1984	the new, less meat-heavy lunch can actually create an infinite amount of joy if the canteen staff are properly dressed for the task and they have a clear mandate from the company

T23	Premise 2622 2778	It ends up with a bit of everything, which no one really has ownership over, which creates a lot of food waste and a far too high CO2 footprint per employee
T24	MajorClaim 2780 2968	If the restructuring is to be successful, the company must first of all take on the host and, based on a sustainability strategy, have a clear attitude to what it serves and why it does it

T31	Premise 3637 3725	It was also not wise to advertise with 'vegetarian leek pie' or 'leek pie without bacon'
T32	Premise 3727 3797	And you don't need to be reminded that the chili is 'sin carne' either
T33	Claim 3799 3919	If we don't call it anything, but simply change the ratio between meat and vegetables, few people will notice the change

T34	Premise 3921 4034	Few people actually think that the food is vegetarian, if only they experience it as delicious, filling and tasty
