T1	Claim 78 351	When we mechanically refer to the food of the future as "plant proteins for human consumption" and "climate food that must not cost the joy of life", we alienate ourselves from our food and manage to neither show the way nor inspire real, sustainable change in food systems
A1	Stance T1 For
T2	Premise 888 984	the minister began with admonishing words that "plant-based foods must not cost the joy of life"
T3	Claim 986 1108	But if a menu description with biorefined grass protein doesn't suck the joy out of you, then we soon don't know what will
A2	Stance T3 For
T4	MajorClaim 1110 1201	There is no doubt about the need to rethink our food system in a more sustainable direction
T5	Claim 1471 1592	why should "plant-based foods" be synonymous with products processed beyond recognition to imitate something they are not
A3	Stance T5 For
T6	Premise 1594 1708	That plant-based food is much more than meat substitutes is such a trite point that it shouldn't need to be raised
T7	Premise 1714 1890	it's as if we've forgotten how simple food can be, and we need to remember that if we want to make real change in our supply chains, not just replace old problems with new ones
T8	Claim 1892 1955	Industry is driving the "protein switch" – and that's a problem
A4	Stance T8 For
T9	Premise 1956 2161	As the University of Copenhagen's conference title testified, both large parts of the research environment and the market-dominant forces in industry have embraced the meat substitute paradigm in a big way
T10	Premise 2641 2850	Yes, the very same industrial conglomerates that dominate the market today and have been instrumental in creating our current food system based on an increasingly fragile, large-scale industrial monoculture do
T11	Premise 2852 2998	In the report The Politics of Protein, IPES-Food warns against single-track agendas that do not take into account how complex our food systems are
T12	Claim 3000 3153	The so-called protein transition simply cannot be boiled down to the popular but simplistic balancing of protein content against greenhouse gas emissions
A5	Stance T12 For
T13	Premise 3222 3482	According to the researchers, the black-and-white view ignores "critical sustainability challenges" such as loss of biodiversity, chemical pollution, deterioration of soil fertility and living conditions for small farmers, hunger and micronutrient deficiencies
T14	Claim 3484 3570	Are these not just as important challenges to bear in mind as the infamous CO2 account
A6	Stance T14 For
T15	Premise 3572 3815	When we plant hectare after hectare of monoculture agriculture in pursuit of pea protein for our plant steaks instead of embracing the diversity – and deliciousness – the plant kingdom offers, we are of course limiting greenhouse gas emissions
T16	Premise 3817 3949	But at the same time we are strengthening the fragile food system, which is the whole reason for the food crisis the world is facing
T17	Premise 3951 4091	From monoculture and mass production to large-scale use of artificial fertilizers and energy-intensive hyper-processing of our raw materials
T18	Premise 4093 4194	According to the FAO, 75 percent of the world's food comes from just 12 plant and five animal species
T19	Premise 4196 4289	It is cheap, effective – and extremely unhealthy for both us humans and the planet we live on
T20	Claim 4302 4412	we cannot continue to design the food system of the future on the premises of large industry and market forces
A7	Stance T20 For
T21	Premise 4527 4703	"Because it's not the companies that are the cause of the environmental impacts, who clean up afterwards. It's the states, it's society and it's the planet that foots the bill"
T22	Claim 4705 4814	We do not need a narrow protein transition in a food industry that is otherwise allowed to rumble on as usual
A8	Stance T22 For
T23	Claim 4816 4867	We need a real, holistic rethinking of food systems
A9	Stance T23 For
T24	Claim 4869 5071	The Norwegian word for sustainable is sustainable, and it very well describes the aim we should have: A food system that has the strength to carry us all – and the many closely linked challenges we face
A10	Stance T24 For
T25	Premise 5614 5709	The food crises are waiting, and we are left with more and more destroyed farmland in our hands
T26	Claim 5822 5916	instead of plowing the same fragile tracks deeper, shouldn't we start new and more robust ones
