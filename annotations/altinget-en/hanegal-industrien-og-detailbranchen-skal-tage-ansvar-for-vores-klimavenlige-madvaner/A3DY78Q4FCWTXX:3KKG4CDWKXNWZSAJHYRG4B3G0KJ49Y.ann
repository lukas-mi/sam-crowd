T5	Premise 481 927	But when the kids are picked up from kindergarten and the shopping needs to be done, while the last e-mails are being answered on the phone hanging over the fridge, and the kids are complaining about mix-your-own sweets and cheese pops, the Danish Food and Veterinary Authority's climate food advice slips into the background, and the good intentions of more climate-friendly eating habits are left in the store along with the pulses and couscous
T6	Premise 929 1000	Although two out of three Danes would like to eat more climate-friendly
T7	Premise 1002 1134	it is difficult to rediscover the good intentions in what we put in the shopping basket when we are stressing around the supermarket
T8	Premise 1156 1339	Denmark takes last place in an EU-supported study of the ability of five European populations to exploit the potential of climate-friendly "superfoods" such as peas, beans and lentils
T9	Premise 1341 1442	According to the researchers behind the study, this is due to ignorance and a lack of food traditions
T10	Premise 1444 1550	The Danish ignorance means that an average Dane emits just over three tonnes of CO2 through the diet alone
T11	Claim 1552 1662	Therefore, there are also quite good opportunities to reduce our CO2 emissions if we eat more climate-friendly
A4	Stance T11 For
T12	Claim 1664 1897	If we followed the Danish Food and Veterinary Authority's climate food advice to eat less meat, more vegetables, more legumes and more whole grains, we could easily lower the CO2 footprint associated with our diet by 30 to 45 percent

T13	Premise 1903 1929	quite a considerable share
T14	Premise 1986 2081	Why is it so infinitely slow to reap the climate benefits when it comes to our food consumption
T15	Premise 2083 2252	Why don't we just change our diet a bit and reap the climate benefits that are right at hand, when we now know that the Danes actually want to live more climate-friendly
T16	Premise 2254 2345	The truth is that we are creatures of habit, and it's hard as hell to get new eating habits
T17	Premise 2347 2387	It requires energy, imagination and time
T18	Premise 2389 2543	And perhaps it also requires a period of sullen children and spouses when the legumes occupy the dinner plates in the place where the red meat used to lie
T19	Premise 2583 2710	the plant-based alternatives may not have been of a quality or at a price where they were a real alternative to the meat either
T20	Premise 2712 2782	A more climate-friendly diet has thus been associated with deprivation
T21	Premise 2784 2866	And if there's one thing we don't like when it comes to our diet, it's deprivation
T22	Claim 2868 2906	The food industry has a responsibility
A6	Stance T22 For
T23	Premise 2994 3178	If we are to have pushed the Danes' eating habits in a more climate-friendly direction, it requires solid legwork and an even greater focus in the food industry and in the retail trade

A7	Stance T24 For
T25	Premise 3288 3367	A more sustainable diet should not taste of deprivation and smell of inadequacy

T27	Premise 3516 3809	In January, the Danish Vegetarian Association, together with a number of retail chains and food manufacturers, carried out the 'Green January' campaign with the aim of making plant-based foods visible in the first month of the year and giving them a little more space in the minds of consumers

A8	Stance T28 For
T29	Claim 4002 4222	I am convinced that the selection of plant-based foods will have reached a level within the coming years where consumers will largely choose the plant-based foods because they are of a quality that makes interesting ones
A9	Stance T29 For
T30	Claim 4224 4335	Only when plant-based foods have reached that level will the market really move in a more sustainable direction
