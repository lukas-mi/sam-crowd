T1	MajorClaim 175 257	we must become better at developing and utilizing the biosolutions we already know
T2	Claim 583 654	we find ourselves in an abundance of crises and imbalances on the globe
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 753 958	Whether it concerns climate change, loss of biodiversity or the food crisis, we can be sure that there are countless researchers at both companies and universities working around the clock on the solutions
T4	Premise 977 1070	there are many of them today who can make a significant difference to the world's populations
T5	Claim 1072 1203	One of these solutions is the development of climate-efficient proteins that can replace and supplement the current animal proteins
A2	Stance T5 For
T6	Claim 1205 1369	The proteins come from, among other things, beans and quinoa, mushrooms and seaweed, which, when fermented, become just as tasty in your smashburger as a beef steak
A3	Stance T6 For
T7	Premise 1385 1474	technology allows us to cultivate new, amazing tastes and can add future food experiences
T8	Premise 1476 1615	Fermentation is, on an equal footing with biorefining, one of the core technologies within biological solutions, also known as biosolutions
T9	Premise 1618 1767	t's fermentation that brews the enzymes in your toothpaste, that turns milk into cheese and yogurt, and that can turn beans into juicy burger patties
T10	Claim 1812 1965	The development of new alternative proteins will not only mean that our protein consumption will require significantly less use of the globe's land areas
A4	Stance T10 For
T11	Claim 1967 2057	It will also lead to CO2 reductions and feed more mouths with the same amount of resources
A5	Stance T11 For
T12	Premise 2059 2139	A recent report from Copenhagen Economics showed the potential of CO2 reductions
T13	Premise 2141 2233	The biosolutions we know today alone can globally reduce CO2 by 4,300 million tonnes by 2030
T14	Premise 2235 2294	This corresponds to eight percent of global emissions today
T15	Premise 2296 2554	This is because biosolutions both lead to more efficient production processes, for example in the form of milk proteins created in fermentation tanks, just as good bacteria can shorten cheese ripening processes and extend the shelf life of many types of food
T16	Premise 2556 2689	All these examples are developed from fermentation, which is the same technology that is also used in developing alternative proteins
T17	Premise 2691 2809	Alternative proteins are a tool that we have known for a long time, but which has often been overlooked in the toolbox
T18	Premise 2820 2930	fermentation technology dates back thousands of years to when we first made cheese and fermented milk products
T19	Premise 2941 3020	in relation to modern alternative foods, consumers have been somewhat skeptical
T20	Premise 3026 3114	as a result many companies have been reluctant to invest in the technologies behind them
T21	Claim 3116 3168	We would like to change that, as time is running out
A6	Stance T21 For
T22	Premise 3196 3310	On top of December's global biodiversity conference (COP15), it is clear that the global food system is challenged
T23	Premise 3322 3379	we are running out of room for an ever-growing population
T24	Claim 3581 3634	we must make it easier to get new foods on the market
A7	Stance T24 For
T25	Claim 3637 3779	o support the development of new, fermented foods and secure the foundation for us to grow proteins in steel tanks with precision fermentation
A8	Stance T25 For
T26	Claim 3781 3913	To design our EU legislation to include an innovation principle when we assess biosolutions that can deliver on our green objectives
A9	Stance T26 For
T27	Premise 3959 4052	we have the tools from the Danish biosolutions industry to deliver significant CO2 reductions
T28	Claim 4060 4139	biosolutions also contribute to the solution of the other sustainability crises
A10	Stance T28 For
T29	Premise 4162 4222	biosolutions are an indispensable tool in the crisis toolbox
T30	Claim 4233 4303	a tool that can only utilize its full potential if EU regulation helps
A11	Stance T30 For
T31	Claim 4309 4402	it is urgent to make it happen, because the imbalances will only get worse the longer we wait
A12	Stance T31 For
T32	Claim 4404 4485	The green transition requires the use of all tools to deal with the global crises
