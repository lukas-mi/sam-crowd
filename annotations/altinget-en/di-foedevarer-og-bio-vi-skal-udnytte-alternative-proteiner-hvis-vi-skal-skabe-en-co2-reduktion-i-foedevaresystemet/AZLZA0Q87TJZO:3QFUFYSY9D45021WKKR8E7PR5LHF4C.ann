T1	MajorClaim 110 257	If we are to make significant CO2 reductions in our food system, we must become better at developing and utilizing the biosolutions we already know
T2	Premise 345 370	The temperature is rising
T3	Premise 372 397	ecosystems are challenged
T4	Premise 399 440	the Horn of Africa is affected by drought
T5	Premise 445 483	in Pakistan the rivers are overflowing
T6	Premise 485 571	Global food systems are under unprecedented pressure from war, inflation and pandemics
T7	Claim 583 654	we find ourselves in an abundance of crises and imbalances on the globe
A1	Stance T7 For
T8	Claim 1072 1203	One of these solutions is the development of climate-efficient proteins that can replace and supplement the current animal proteins
A2	Stance T8 For
T9	Premise 1205 1369	The proteins come from, among other things, beans and quinoa, mushrooms and seaweed, which, when fermented, become just as tasty in your smashburger as a beef steak
T10	Claim 1385 1474	technology allows us to cultivate new, amazing tastes and can add future food experiences
A3	Stance T10 For
T11	Claim 1812 1965	The development of new alternative proteins will not only mean that our protein consumption will require significantly less use of the globe's land areas
A4	Stance T11 For
T12	Claim 1967 2057	It will also lead to CO2 reductions and feed more mouths with the same amount of resources
A5	Stance T12 For
T13	Premise 2141 2233	The biosolutions we know today alone can globally reduce CO2 by 4,300 million tonnes by 2030
T14	Premise 2312 2554	biosolutions both lead to more efficient production processes, for example in the form of milk proteins created in fermentation tanks, just as good bacteria can shorten cheese ripening processes and extend the shelf life of many types of food
T15	Premise 2941 3020	in relation to modern alternative foods, consumers have been somewhat skeptical
T16	Claim 3038 3114	many companies have been reluctant to invest in the technologies behind them
A6	Stance T16 Against
T17	Claim 3322 3379	we are running out of room for an ever-growing population
A7	Stance T17 For
T18	Premise 3394 3515	Danish companies within the biosolutions sector are jumping ahead to deliver the solutions of the future already tomorrow
T19	Claim 3581 3634	we must make it easier to get new foods on the market
A8	Stance T19 For
T20	Claim 3959 4052	we have the tools from the Danish biosolutions industry to deliver significant CO2 reductions
A9	Stance T20 For
T21	Claim 4060 4139	biosolutions also contribute to the solution of the other sustainability crises
A10	Stance T21 For
T22	MajorClaim 4162 4222	biosolutions are an indispensable tool in the crisis toolbox
