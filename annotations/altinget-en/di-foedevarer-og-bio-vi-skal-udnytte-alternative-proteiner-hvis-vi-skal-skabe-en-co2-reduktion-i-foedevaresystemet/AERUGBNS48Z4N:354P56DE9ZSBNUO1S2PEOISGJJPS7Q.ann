T1	MajorClaim 110 257	If we are to make significant CO2 reductions in our food system, we must become better at developing and utilizing the biosolutions we already know
T2	Claim 1072 1203	One of these solutions is the development of climate-efficient proteins that can replace and supplement the current animal proteins
A1	Stance T2 For
T3	Premise 1205 1369	The proteins come from, among other things, beans and quinoa, mushrooms and seaweed, which, when fermented, become just as tasty in your smashburger as a beef steak
T4	Premise 1385 1474	technology allows us to cultivate new, amazing tastes and can add future food experiences
T5	Claim 1476 1615	Fermentation is, on an equal footing with biorefining, one of the core technologies within biological solutions, also known as biosolutions
A2	Stance T5 For
T6	Premise 1617 1716	It's fermentation that brews the enzymes in your toothpaste, that turns milk into cheese and yogurt
T7	Premise 1722 1767	that can turn beans into juicy burger patties
T8	Claim 1812 1965	The development of new alternative proteins will not only mean that our protein consumption will require significantly less use of the globe's land areas
A3	Stance T8 For
T9	Claim 1967 2057	It will also lead to CO2 reductions and feed more mouths with the same amount of resources
A4	Stance T9 For
T10	Premise 2059 2139	A recent report from Copenhagen Economics showed the potential of CO2 reductions
T11	Premise 2141 2233	The biosolutions we know today alone can globally reduce CO2 by 4,300 million tonnes by 2030
T12	Premise 2235 2294	This corresponds to eight percent of global emissions today
T13	Premise 2312 2445	biosolutions both lead to more efficient production processes, for example in the form of milk proteins created in fermentation tanks
T14	Premise 2455 2554	good bacteria can shorten cheese ripening processes and extend the shelf life of many types of food
T15	Premise 2556 2689	All these examples are developed from fermentation, which is the same technology that is also used in developing alternative proteins
T16	Claim 2691 2809	Alternative proteins are a tool that we have known for a long time, but which has often been overlooked in the toolbox
A5	Stance T16 For
T17	Premise 2820 2930	fermentation technology dates back thousands of years to when we first made cheese and fermented milk products
T18	Premise 2941 3020	in relation to modern alternative foods, consumers have been somewhat skeptical
T19	Premise 3038 3114	many companies have been reluctant to invest in the technologies behind them
T20	Claim 3196 3310	On top of December's global biodiversity conference (COP15), it is clear that the global food system is challenged
A6	Stance T20 For
T21	Premise 3312 3379	In short, we are running out of room for an ever-growing population
T22	Premise 3394 3515	Danish companies within the biosolutions sector are jumping ahead to deliver the solutions of the future already tomorrow
T23	Premise 3521 3568	here we are the market leader on a global level
T24	Claim 3581 3634	we must make it easier to get new foods on the market
A7	Stance T24 For
T25	Premise 3636 3779	To support the development of new, fermented foods and secure the foundation for us to grow proteins in steel tanks with precision fermentation
T26	Premise 3781 3913	To design our EU legislation to include an innovation principle when we assess biosolutions that can deliver on our green objectives
T27	Claim 3959 4052	we have the tools from the Danish biosolutions industry to deliver significant CO2 reductions
A8	Stance T27 For
T28	Premise 4060 4139	biosolutions also contribute to the solution of the other sustainability crises
T29	Claim 4162 4222	biosolutions are an indispensable tool in the crisis toolbox
A9	Stance T29 For
T30	Premise 4228 4303	also a tool that can only utilize its full potential if EU regulation helps
T31	Claim 4309 4402	it is urgent to make it happen, because the imbalances will only get worse the longer we wait
A10	Stance T31 For
T32	Premise 4404 4485	The green transition requires the use of all tools to deal with the global crises
