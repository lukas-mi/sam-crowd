T1	MajorClaim 163 225	alternative, lab-grown foods, could have terrible consequences
T2	Claim 1559 1652	he wrote that organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb are the “world’s most damaging farm products
A1	Stance T2 Against
T3	Premise 1655 1769	He criticises “chefs and foodies” like me for focusing on regenerative grazing, which he calls “rebranded ranching
T4	Claim 1772 1910	His alternative vision includes a revolution in creating food through precision fermentation: growing food in labs from microbes and water
A2	Stance T4 Against
T5	Premise 1913 2044	Before long, most of our food will come neither from animals nor plants, but from unicellular life,” he wrote in this paper in 2020
T6	Claim 2097 2153	I am much more for small-scale, community-driven farming
A3	Stance T6 For
T7	Premise 2162 2255	I believe in the potential of food to be a force for good, for human and environmental health
T8	Premise 2257 2515	The methods that regenerative farmers such as the writer Gabe Brown propose have shown how non-intensive livestock, when managed well, can increase topsoil more than previously thought, which can then accumulate biomass (carbon) and retain precious rainwater
T9	Claim 2517 2651	The argument put forward by Monbiot that it is not possible to produce enough food this way is often used to decry better food systems
A4	Stance T9 Against
T10	Premise 2657 2782	according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, small-scale farmers currently produce about a third of our food
T11	Premise 2853 3036	Just about all of this new food technology is heavily funded by tech oligarchs, venture capitalists or the occasional celebrity,” writes the retail podcaster Errol Schweizer in Forbes
T12	Claim 3038 3159	Precision fermentation claims to get us off our destructive addiction to cheap meat, but not without potential downsides.
A5	Stance T12 Against
T13	Premise 3160 3338	These inventions are heavily patented, pushing the future of our food supply further into the hands of an increasingly small and powerful collection of multinational food players
T14	Claim 3341 3544	There is very little transparency about the amount of energy and materials needed to build the system of factories that would be needed to adopt these foods to the degree that their proponents would like
A6	Stance T14 For
T15	Premise 3546 3580	How fossil-fuel dependent are they
T16	Premise 3582 3685	How many other chemicals and compounds are needed to make them, and where will we get them from and how
T17	Premise 3687 3785	In our race to look for better systems of food production it is tempting to look for magic bullets
T18	Claim 3791 3827	we cannot afford to ignore the risks
A7	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 3829 3884	Ultra-processed foods make up half of the UK’s calories
T20	Claim 3890 3978	their health impact gets very little attention from the government or in medical schools
A8	Stance T20 For
T21	Premise 3980 4126	We know that other ultra-processed foods – even some plant-based meat alternatives – are high in protein but can also be very high in salt and fat
T22	Premise 4128 4423	Companies that practise regenerative farming, such as Hodmedod’s in the UK, are producing affordable pulses and grains that are rich in protein and fibre, through a cooperative of small-scale farms that almost all use some grazing animals in their systems to aid the nutrient cycle in their soil
T23	Claim 4425 4564	In these types of farms, small herds of cattle or sheep graze diverse cover crops, boosting the biodiversity on their land, not reducing it
A9	Stance T23 For
T24	Premise 4602 4687	The cover crops build back goodness in the soil and remove the need to use pesticides
T25	Premise 4689 4759	The presence of livestock adds nutrients through their muck and saliva
T26	Premise 4761 4872	They also add the nutrients to our diets: animal fats from grass-fed animals are hard to replace in human diets
T27	Premise 4880 4966	the livestock adds an extra revenue stream for the farmers, making them more resilient
T28	Premise 4968 5204	Through the work we do at the charity Chefs in Schools, I have seen first-hand how it is possible to feed people food that is high in fibre and in flavour, and that costs less than the ultra-processed food children were being fed before
T29	Claim 5206 5480	With the right political will (60% of secondary schools are currently failing school food standards and food plays no role in actual Ofsted ratings), we can feed people on all incomes a better diet, not just through schools but also in hospitals, prisons and social canteens
A10	Stance T29 For
T30	Premise 5482 5676	If we continue to go down the ultra-processed route then food may well continue to make people sick, which, according to Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Plan, costs the economy an estimated £74bn
T31	Premise 5741 5877	I am open to plant-based foods if we can move away from making them with the mono-crops that are so destructive to animal life and soils
T32	Premise 5883 5959	I am all for technology, but as long as it works with nature, not against it
T33	Claim 5961 6055	We need better funding for soil science and for feeding proper food to people on lower incomes
A11	Stance T33 For
T34	Premise 6133 6361	the evidence of the past 70 years suggests that when we replace nature’s complex biology with a tunnel-visioned look at certain aspects of chemistry and ignore others, it has profoundly negative and often unforeseen consequences
T35	Claim 6363 6461	In nature the animal and vegetable worlds are never separate – we should learn something from that
