A3	Stance T7 Against
T8	Claim 2257 2515	The methods that regenerative farmers such as the writer Gabe Brown propose have shown how non-intensive livestock, when managed well, can increase topsoil more than previously thought, which can then accumulate biomass (carbon) and retain precious rainwater
A4	Stance T8 For
T9	Premise 2517 2651	The argument put forward by Monbiot that it is not possible to produce enough food this way is often used to decry better food systems

T11	Claim 3038 3158	Precision fermentation claims to get us off our destructive addiction to cheap meat, but not without potential downsides
A5	Stance T11 For
T12	Premise 3160 3338	These inventions are heavily patented, pushing the future of our food supply further into the hands of an increasingly small and powerful collection of multinational food players
T13	Claim 3341 3544	There is very little transparency about the amount of energy and materials needed to build the system of factories that would be needed to adopt these foods to the degree that their proponents would like
A6	Stance T13 For
T14	Premise 3546 3580	How fossil-fuel dependent are they
T15	Premise 3582 3644	How many other chemicals and compounds are needed to make them

T17	Claim 3829 3884	Ultra-processed foods make up half of the UK’s calories
A7	Stance T17 For
T18	Claim 3890 3978	their health impact gets very little attention from the government or in medical schools
A8	Stance T18 For
T19	Premise 3980 4126	We know that other ultra-processed foods – even some plant-based meat alternatives – are high in protein but can also be very high in salt and fat
T20	Claim 4425 4547	In these types of farms, small herds of cattle or sheep graze diverse cover crops, boosting the biodiversity on their land
A9	Stance T20 For
T21	Premise 4602 4687	The cover crops build back goodness in the soil and remove the need to use pesticides
T22	Premise 4689 4759	The presence of livestock adds nutrients through their muck and saliva
T23	Claim 4761 4801	They also add the nutrients to our diets
A10	Stance T23 For
T24	Premise 4803 4872	animal fats from grass-fed animals are hard to replace in human diets
T25	Claim 5051 5122	it is possible to feed people food that is high in fibre and in flavour

T26	Claim 5128 5204	that costs less than the ultra-processed food children were being fed before
A12	Stance T26 For
T27	Premise 5482 5676	If we continue to go down the ultra-processed route then food may well continue to make people sick, which, according to Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Plan, costs the economy an estimated £74bn

A13	Stance T28 For
T29	MajorClaim 6181 6361	when we replace nature’s complex biology with a tunnel-visioned look at certain aspects of chemistry and ignore others, it has profoundly negative and often unforeseen consequences
