T1	MajorClaim 163 225	alternative, lab-grown foods, could have terrible consequences
T2	Premise 678 854	It is indisputable that the farming “revolution” of the 1950s, with its widespread use of ammonia fertilisers and herbicides, pesticides and fungicides, has waged war on nature
T3	Premise 856 1144	These intensive, monocultural ways of producing food are not only contaminating our land and waterways, but are heating up our planet and contributing to a crisis in human health (more people die of diet-related disease globally than smoking, according to a study published in the Lancet)
T4	Premise 1146 1205	The animals in factory farms don’t have a great time either
T5	Premise 1207 1327	The decline of insect life is incredibly worrying: without the earthworm, beetle and bee, life as we know it could cease
T6	Premise 1329 1421	opsoils, which we use to grow 95% of the world’s food, are depleting at an astonishing rate
T7	Claim 1423 1502	We need to change the way we eat and produce food, and we need to do it quickly
A1	Stance T7 For
T8	Claim 1538 1653	in a recent article, he wrote that organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb are the “world’s most damaging farm products”
A2	Stance T8 Against
T9	Claim 1655 1770	He criticises “chefs and foodies” like me for focusing on regenerative grazing, which he calls “rebranded ranching”
A3	Stance T9 Against
T10	Premise 1772 1910	His alternative vision includes a revolution in creating food through precision fermentation: growing food in labs from microbes and water
T11	Premise 1912 2044	“Before long, most of our food will come neither from animals nor plants, but from unicellular life,” he wrote in this paper in 2020
T12	Claim 2517 2651	The argument put forward by Monbiot that it is not possible to produce enough food this way is often used to decry better food systems
A4	Stance T12 Against
T13	Premise 2657 2782	according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, small-scale farmers currently produce about a third of our food
T14	Premise 2852 3036	“Just about all of this new food technology is heavily funded by tech oligarchs, venture capitalists or the occasional celebrity,” writes the retail podcaster Errol Schweizer in Forbes
T15	Claim 3038 3158	Precision fermentation claims to get us off our destructive addiction to cheap meat, but not without potential downsides
A5	Stance T15 For
T16	Premise 3160 3338	These inventions are heavily patented, pushing the future of our food supply further into the hands of an increasingly small and powerful collection of multinational food players
T17	Premise 3341 3544	There is very little transparency about the amount of energy and materials needed to build the system of factories that would be needed to adopt these foods to the degree that their proponents would like
T18	Claim 3687 3827	In our race to look for better systems of food production it is tempting to look for magic bullets, but we cannot afford to ignore the risks
A6	Stance T18 For
T19	Claim 5206 5480	With the right political will (60% of secondary schools are currently failing school food standards and food plays no role in actual Ofsted ratings), we can feed people on all incomes a better diet, not just through schools but also in hospitals, prisons and social canteens
A7	Stance T19 For
T20	Claim 5482 5676	If we continue to go down the ultra-processed route then food may well continue to make people sick, which, according to Henry Dimbleby’s National Food Plan, costs the economy an estimated £74bn
A8	Stance T20 For
T21	Claim 5961 6055	We need better funding for soil science and for feeding proper food to people on lower incomes
A9	Stance T21 For
T22	Claim 6057 6084	We need to change our diets
A10	Stance T22 For
T23	Claim 6086 6127	We do have to eat significantly less meat
A11	Stance T23 For
T24	MajorClaim 6133 6361	the evidence of the past 70 years suggests that when we replace nature’s complex biology with a tunnel-visioned look at certain aspects of chemistry and ignore others, it has profoundly negative and often unforeseen consequences
