Paragraphs 1 to 4:
- Do not contain any arguments.
- The content is of informative nature: mentioning statistics and events that happened in the past.
Paragraph 5:
- The claim expresses opinion that what's happening to salmon may be bad for us humans. This is supported by explanation in the next sentence talking about poor living conditions of the fish, which implicitly implies that such fish may be sold to consumers.
Paragraph 6:
- The last sentence is a claim, which is supported the premise in the sentence just before (provides figures on the growth of the salmon industry).
Paragraph 7:
- The first occurrence of the MajorClaim is stated. This statement is closely related to the title, which asks whether Scotland will address fish farming problems. The major claim urges to address this problem.
Paragraph 8:
- Is just a heading for introduction
Paragraph 9:
- First two sentences presents 2 claims, which are more abstract but still should be annotated.
- The next sentence includes a statement, which can be interpreted as an attacking premise, since previous claim states that we must be careful with the planet's limited resources, yet about 15 million salmon died due to people's fault.
Paragraph 10:
- Contains a claim that is explained by a supporting premise.
Paragraph 11:
- The first sentence presents a claim that is supported by the two premises in the following sentences.
- The second to last sentence contains another claim.
Paragraph 12:
- Another heading without any arguments.
Paragraph 13:
- The first sentence is just an observation of what was expressed so far and what will follow.
- The second sentence contains two components: a concluding statement as a claim that is preceded by a supporting premise, which explains the reasoning behind the claim.
Paragraph 14:
- Both statements in isolation could be considered as claims, however, they are related to one another by contradiction ("Yet"). Since the latter one appears to be the concluding one and has stronger implications, it is considered as a claim with the "Against" stance toward the MajorClaim. Then, the first sentence is a premise that attacks the claim.
Paragraph 15:
- Another heading without any arguments.
Paragraphs 16 and 17:
- Two longer premises in the 16th paragraph give more detail and as a result support the statement in the first sentence of paragraph 17. This sentence could be considered as a claim, however, it is followed by a concluding statement in the last sentence, thus, the first sentence is annotated as a supporting premise to the claim. To see the connection more clearly between the two sentences they could be combined with a word "therefore" to outline that "Swift action must be taken" is a conclusion or consequence that rose due to "... ever-increasing mortality rates on salmon farms".
Paragraphs 18 to 21:
- Contains no arguments and just informs the reader.
Paragraph 22:
- There is another MajorClaim occurrence here, which is not exactly the same as the first one but drives a very similar point.
Paragraph 23:
- No arguments.
Paragraph 24:
- The last sentence contains a claim saying that there is a strong dependence on the government. This claim is supported by the statement before, which mentions that government did listen and act in the past, thus, implying that it might happen in the future.
Paragraph 25:
- The last claim of the article.
