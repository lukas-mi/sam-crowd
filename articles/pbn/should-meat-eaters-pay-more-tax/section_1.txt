Taxes On Meat – Should We Pay Less For Vegan Food?

Toward the end of last year, a senior UK politician named Alok Sharma – who had recently been appointed as president of Climate Change conference COP26 – was asked whether the government would be introducing a tax on meat in light of its environmental costs.
He was adamantly against the idea, explaining: “I have been very clear that, on a personal level, I am someone who very much believes in carrot rather than stick, trying to encourage people to move in the right direction.”
When asked whether people should eat less meat to save the planet, he said doing so was a ‘personal choice’.
Animal agriculture is catastrophic for the environment, contributing to land degradation, water, and air pollution, resource use, loss of biodiversity, and global warming.
While there’s debate in the scientific community on the proportion of emissions it’s responsible for, it is generally understood to be at least 14.5 percent.
While animal agriculture is of course not the only issue that needs addressing, it should be an essential part of any environmental plan.
A major study from 2018 found that Western countries would need to reduce beef consumption by 90 percent to avoid dangerous climate change, and the UN recently endorseda report urging world leaders to shift away from animal agriculture and move towards plant-based food systems.
Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence, there remains a reluctance from politicians and the general public to accept that we urgently need to switch up our diets.
