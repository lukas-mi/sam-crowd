Farm subsidies
It is thought that the tax-payer provides more than $1 million per minute in global farm subsidies. In the UK, around 90 percent of the income of farmers with grazing livestock comes from subsidies.
In the US, tens of billions of dollars are given to farmers each year.
The Trump administration gave a $16 billion support package payout on top of regular subsidies in 2019, while at the same time cutting $5 billion from the food stamps budget.
This level of support has created a system where unhealthy meat products – like cheap fast food – are more accessible than fruits and vegetables.
If crop farming was given this funding, it has the potential to provide far cheaper food for more people than our current system does. Crop farming requires considerably less land and resources than animal farming and would be vastly more efficient at feeding the population if it was prioritized.
We are wasting money that could be used to make widespread cheaper food on ailing industries that are inept at feeding the population and accelerating the world toward environmental destruction.
Not a quick-fix
Governments should stop subsidizing meat and dairy industries, and instead direct money to crop farming while helping existing animal farmers move towards it.
While a meat tax has the potential to be a positive step in a move toward a plant-based system, it should by no means be a standalone policy.
There needs to be an urgent shift in our food system away from animal agriculture, and governments should allocate funding to reflect this.
After years of marketing campaigns that sold the public the wildly incorrect idea that meat and dairy is an essential component of a balanced diet, they should also take steps to educate the public on the benefits of plant-based eating.
