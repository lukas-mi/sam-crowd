Taxes On Meat – Should We Pay Less For Vegan Food?

Disproportionate effects
But it’s undeniable that increases such as these would at first glance seem to be contributing to already sky-rocketing food costs, and critics of the meat tax have argued that it would disproportionately effect the poor.
This is a hugely important point and one that proponents of meat taxes cannot ignore.
If such a tax were introduced, it is arguable that the fall in consumption would be largely due to the fact that some people would no longer be able to afford it, while the richest would continue buying meat unscathed.
But governments shouldn’t introduce a meat tax and then trot off and leave the public to pick up the pieces. It should be just one of a number of measures they should take to move toward a plant-based food system that creates accessible food for all.
Researchers in the Oxford study found that, as well as its ability to reduce meat consumption, one of the ‘key advantages’ of meat tax is that it could create revenue to help farmers move to alternative income streams and give support to people from low-income families.
“There are ways to ensure that meat taxes do not put additional financial pressure on those with low income,” said Franziska Funke, lead author, and researcher in the study.
“That is why we suggest that meat tax revenues should be redistributed to support low-income households or subsidize fruit and vegetables.”
According to this research, most people on low incomes could end up with more money than before a meat tax reform.
