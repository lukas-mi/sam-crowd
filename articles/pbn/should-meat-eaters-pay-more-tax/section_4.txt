Nutrition
Some people may argue that this system is unfair and would leave people lacking in vital nutrition.
But the idea that meat is an essential part of our diet comes from decades of clever marketing and ignores the numerous studies that have concluded plant-based diets are optimum for humans, as well as the link between meat consumption and disease.
Whatâ€™s more, the long-term aim should not be that some people continue eating meat while others go without. A meat tax could be a vital step in tackling the meat consumption problem, but it is not the complete solution.
Governments should work to make plant-based diets the norm by making them accessible to everyone.
The reason why meat products are so prevalent in our society is because governments give away billions in subsidies to animal agriculture.
Subsidies are tax-payer-funded grants that governments give to industries to keep down costs, therefore making their products more accessible to the consumer.
