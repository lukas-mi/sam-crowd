Demand for ‘meaty’ vegan food
Some people may argue that it’s their higher price, rather than lack of appeal, that makes plant-based alternatives less attractive. It is true that they do tend to be more expensive than their traditional counterparts, but this hasn’t stopped the growth of alternative milks.
Perhaps then, we are thinking about it the wrong way.
The more I talk to non-vegans who are interested in the idea of reducing their meat intake (the “plant forward” or flexitarian folks), the more I hear the same thing: they like the idea of plant-based, but would prefer a cauliflower steak to an exact replica of meat.
Maybe we need to get over the notion that animal meat and dairy are the ultimate paradigms, that if we can’t replicate that, we won’t succeed. Sure, people may want something “meaty” or “milky,” but maybe they just want something that tastes good. And, another thought: maybe they just want something new.
At one time, a standard steak-and-potato was considered the ultimate meal in America. Then came Chinese, Thai, Indian, sushi, molecular gastronomy, and so many new world, worldly, and other-worldly cuisine and food ideas. Remember when no one knew how to pronounce quinoa 20 years ago? Now, it’s in a wrap in the United lounge at airports.
Maybe we just need to create alternatives that can take the place of meat and milk that just taste great, instead of trying to replicate them exactly. We don’t need to be a “better alternative” – we can be a “new alternative.” Better may be better, but “new” might be best, and actually capable of setting a new paradigm.
In other words, maybe we can just be ourselves, and not try to be someone else.
