Why Brands Should Stop Launching Vegan Burgers (And What They Should Build Instead)

Brands are launching vegan burgers left, right, and center - maybe it's time they got some new ideas
Heinz has just announced its entry into the plant-based meat space with the launch of vegan burgers and mince.
I’m thrilled. This is great from an industry standpoint, and sees one of the heavyweights entering the fray. Heinz is a company with the distribution network to secure significant physical availability, and a gigantic advertising budget to secure what we in the brand and marketing world call “mental availability.”
Have we reached saturation?
In my opinion, however, we do not need another burger product in this category.
Join me on a little experiment: type “vegan burger” into Ocado’s search right now. At the time of writing, it returns 49 results. Type “beef burger” into Ocado’s search, and it returns only 32 products… some of which are vegan burgers.
Oh, and some of these are actually dog treats.
The point is: there are a staggering number of vegan burgers, and this space is massively oversaturated.
