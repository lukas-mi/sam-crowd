Combining cultivated and plant-based meat is unlikely to be the key to consumers craving slaughter-free protein
Cultivated meat (also referred to as cultured and clean meat) is being hailed by those in the sector as the future of sustainable food.
Animal agriculture is catastrophic for the environment, responsible for at least 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Itâ€™s also a public health risk, as factory farming is linked to an increased likelihood of future pandemics. These issues combined make it clear that a move away from meat is essential, and cultivated meat has been heralded as the answer.
Currently, it is only available in Singapore, and has yet to be approved in any other countries. Lengthy regulatory approval processes and consumer wariness look to be hard-to-overcome obstacles for its continued growth.
As a way to gently usher cultured meat products into the food system, hybrid developments are being suggested. Created by blending plant-based protein with cultivated meat, the result is supposedly a cleaner, tastier meat product. It also requires no intensive animal agriculture or animal slaughter.
American news publication Vox compares the move to the introduction of hybrid cars. It says that they eventually led to the accepted commercialization of fully electric vehicles. However, the success of hybrid meat will likely hinge on capturing a specific contingent of consumers who are already open to cultured developments. So, is it necessary?
