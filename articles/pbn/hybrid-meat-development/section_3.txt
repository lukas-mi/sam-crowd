Is ‘Hybrid Meat’ The Key To Consumer Acceptance Of Cultivated Animal Products?

Why hybrid meat is probably not the answer
As a route to gain consumer acceptance of cultivated meat, hybrid products are not guaranteed success. Given that hesitation is largely predicated on a feeling that meat grown in bioreactors is less natural than that produced by slaughter, hybrid developments may face exactly the same consumer reluctance. It will also be subject to the same regulatory delays, meaning it won’t accelerate acceptance either.
These issues raise the question: is it worth developing hybrid products? Some manufacturers might claim that it will bolster flexitarian numbers. However, other observers have identified that standard hybrid products are already doing so.
Blending plant proteins with conventional meat to reduce the amount of animal protein in popular products such as burgers and sausages is witnessing a surge in popularity.
The Guardian recently reported that such developments are seen as a healthy alternative to standard meat and tastier than straight-up vegan products. They are also hoped to be a gateway to increased flexitarianism and potentially, meat-free living for more people.
It might be best not to muddy the waters. Keep cultivated meat as an exciting but standalone new development that seeks to reduce the environmental impact of standard meat by up to 96 percent, and let hybrid and totally meat-free products take an alternative path.
