Is ‘Hybrid Meat’ The Key To Consumer Acceptance Of Cultivated Animal Products?

How close to commercialization is cultivated meat?
The process of bringing cultured meat to consumers is not simple. While the production mechanics, which see single cells taken, supposedly painlessly, from animals and then grown in bioreactors to create meat products, is more widely understood, approvals have been slow to materialize.
To date, only Singapore has granted regulatory approval for the production and commercial sale of cultivated meat. Even then, it has only given permission for two chicken developments from one company, Eat Just.
Despite rumors that the US would be following suit a year ago, with domestic cultivated interest Upside Foods building a large production facility in readiness, no approvals have been granted. Though President Biden appears to have recently given the green light for progression in his recent biotech-focused executive order.
The EU has also been slow to support its burgeoning cultivated sector. This is the case despite it including major players such as the Netherlands’ Mosa Meat and France’s Gourmey.
Aside from a lack of infrastructure in place to support global cultivated production, consumer perceptions could also stunt sector progress.
Last year, an Australian study reported that 72 percent of diners are not willing to consider cultured meat yet. The findings are significant, as Australia is one of the biggest consumers of meat worldwide.
