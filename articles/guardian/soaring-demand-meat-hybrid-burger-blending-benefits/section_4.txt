How can we cut soaring demand for meat? Try a hybrid burger

If you eat meat, this is something you can try yourself – next time you use mince in a bolognese, burger, or chilli, substitute 50% of the volume with lentils or chopped mushrooms. You may well even prefer it – in blind taste tests, a recent study found that consumers actually ranked the taste of blended burgers above beef burgers. Perhaps most interesting of all, preferences for blended burgers increased when the consumers were told they were blended, possibly because people valued their environmental and health credentials.
Solutions rarely look this promising, even on paper. However, some large companies have had only limited success trying to launch new blended products. Here they were trying to create a new product category, and like pure plant-based products, faced challenges in communicating their benefits. To achieve near-term benefits, we probably just need to blend plants into existing meat products – in the UK, a “beef burger” is legally defined as having at least 62% beef, and ingredient lists make it clear what is in products.
Ultimately, these products are better for health, the environment and animal welfare than meat, and can taste better too: if we can get that message across, and change these products carefully, it might open up this essential solution.
