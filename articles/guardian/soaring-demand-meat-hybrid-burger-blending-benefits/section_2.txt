How can we cut soaring demand for meat? Try a hybrid burger

Meat alternatives are helping some convert to a plant-based lifestyle. They have grown rapidly in recent years and, on the face of it, offer a good taste at a fraction of the environmental impact of meat and without animal slaughter. However, the pace of growth has not been fast enough to achieve the scale of change needed. In the US, for example, plant-based meat alternatives represented just 1.4% of sales in 2021. McDonaldâ€™s recently launched the McPlant plant-based burger, which was successful enough to stay on the menu in the UK, but not in the US.
There is another way to reduce meat consumption. It uses a change in how food is produced to change what we consume. It can be deployed immediately and at scale. The meat in burgers or similar foods could be blended with plant-based meat alternatives, or with fresh ingredients such as mushrooms or lentils.
Discussions about the benefits of blended products have been circulating for a few years: in 2015, the James Beard Foundation started running a competition for chefs to make tastier blended burgers. The difference now is that, given the small market share of meat alternatives, and the need to cut meat consumption, blended products might be essential to achieve international sustainability targets at the scale and speed required.
