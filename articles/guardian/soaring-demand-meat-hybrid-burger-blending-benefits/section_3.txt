How can we cut soaring demand for meat? Try a hybrid burger

Using data on the environmental impacts of food, I estimated what would happen if two food companies which represent 2-3% of global beef purchases – Burger King and McDonald’s – swapped out 50% of the beef in their burgers for plant-based meat to create blended burgers. Demand for global agricultural land would reduce by about 8.5m hectares (21m acres). That’s an area the size of Ireland. Given total agricultural area is actually declining at the global level, it is unlikely that new farmland would simply take the place of former grazing areas. Instead, as happened when wool demand collapsed during the 1990s, the land would probably revert to nature.
As well as the benefits for wildlife and biodiversity, this land could remove 17m tonnes of CO2 from the air each year for 100 years on average as trees regrow. The process could even be sped up by engaging landowners to replant trees, as the “grain for green” programme did in China.
Cows also create substantial greenhouse gas emissions related to their feed, their excreta and from methane-producing bacteria in their gut. Substituting 50% of the beef in these fast-food chain burgers for plants would reduce these greenhouse gas emissions by 34m tonnes of CO2 equivalents a year. Combined, this is a reduction of 51m tonnes of CO2 equivalent, and more than 80% of the way to both companies’ net zero targets. From an animal welfare perspective, this change would lead to 4m fewer cows being reared and slaughtered each year. Further, research has found that even small substitutions of processed red meat for plant-based meat alternatives are associated with reductions in heart disease, diabetes and overall mortality.
