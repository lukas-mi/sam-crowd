There are many climate-friendly options in the distribution of new Danish proteins such as horse beans. But green proteins cannot yet stand alone in Denmark, so it is crucial that sustainable soy continues to be prioritized by the sector and at Christiansborg.
The soya plant has a very central role as an ingredient in Danish food production, for example for use in feed in animal production. And that has actually been the case for many years.
Soy has a particularly good property in terms of adding proteins to the feed, which ensures that farm animals get the right nutrition. Very few other ingredients have been able to be as effective as soy in food production, as soy's composition of the so-called amino acids is close to ideal.
Soy, on the other hand, has also given rise to a political debate at home. The extreme political left has on several occasions attacked agriculture with criticism of the import of soy, which comes primarily from South America and China.
The criticism is particularly directed at deforestation and the inclusion of vulnerable natural areas with a harmful effect on biodiversity and climate.
